# webApps

This repo is all about my webapps. Single Page Apps (SPAs) are the focus.

## APPS LIST

### ping.php

* continually pings with 1 packet just to see if theres a connection to a certain server. I needed this to test my mesh vpn network from within my server stack already. Basically, it checks to see if the server itself can check for an address.

### critterlog.php

* using a map to track animal sightings. Primarily made to share with my family so they can track for hunting and fishing on a shared map.

### sysData.php

* server infomrational dashboard

### PromptForge.html

* was going to be a browser based markdown editor, but I didnt really like how it turned out so I abandoned it.

### WarpCore.html

* a very inaccurate benchmarking tool.
